This research project leverages cognitive science theories, notably the 4E framework of cognition, to develop an advanced AI agent. Utilizing Unity and the ML-Agents API, the project employs Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) principles to train the agent. The culmination of this endeavor is the agent's participation in a search and gather competition, showcasing its capabilities in autonomous decision-making and task execution within complex environments.
